data:
  rms_noise: 700.0e-15                  # set the noise level to stdandard deviation of 700 fT
  depth_range: [0.615, 0.78]            # percent of radius from which dipole can be drawn  (3.5cm to 2.0 cm deep)
  moment_magnitude: 10.0e-9             # 10e-9 is magnitude of dipole moment given in Hamalainen. We scale by 10 here since localization is poor for the given noise level.
